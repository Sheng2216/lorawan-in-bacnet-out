Next select "Devices" from Workspace Permissions List

Click on "Add Permission for all Devices in Workspace"

Here you select "Can record measurements"

Press "Save" to create the Token![loading-ag-5133](assets/image-20220922143936789.png)

The following element will be added to the modal:Next copy the Token from Datacake (click on the "Show" Button to see and copy the Token)

Now switch back to your Application on TTS:

![image-20220922145020806](assets/image-20220922145020806.png)

- Enter a webhook idÔºàlike ‚Äúsensorhub‚ÄùÔºâ
- Paste the copied Token into the field "Token"
- Create Datacake Webhook on TTI by clicking on the "Create datacake webhook" Button

That's it. You've now created and set up the Datacake Integration on your TheThingsIndustries Instance. If you have any questions please feel free to ask us. 

# Create your own Device

In many cases it makes sense that you do not create a device on the basis of a template, but start from scratch. In some cases it is also not possible to use a Datacake Template. The reasons for this could be, for example: 

- Your device does not yet have a Datacake Template 
- You develop your own devices (example: via ESP32 or Arduino)
- You need special functionalities that are not covered by the default Template
1. To add your Sensor Hub, click the **+ Add Device** button.
2. Select **LoRaWAN** and click **Next**.

![image-20220922145603836](assets/image-20220922145603836.png)

Add device

1. As this is a new device and does not have a ready-to-use template, on the Step 2 tab, click **New Product** and give it a name in the **Product Name** field. Then click **Next**.

![image-20220922150125324](assets/image-20220922150125324.png)

Add API device step 2

Please choose the**The Things Stack V3** LoRaWAN Network Server that your devices are connected to.

![image-20220922145816684](assets/image-20220922145816684.png)

Add Network Server step 2

On the Step 3 tab, Fill in the device **DEVEUI**. Give a name for your Sensor Hub in the **Name** field. Click **Next** to continue.

![image-20220922145925393](assets/image-20220922145925393.png)

Add Device step 3

1. In the last step, choose the payment plan of your device fleet. For this example, we will use the **Free** plan. After the payment plan is selected, click **Add 1 device**.

![image-20220922145940850](assets/image-20220922145940850.png)

Payment plan

1. Now you can see your device registered in the **Devices** tab.

Registered device

## Create Payload Decoder

Next step is that you add your custom payload decoder or write it directly on Datacake as the platform provides all the necessary tools for this:

- JavaScript based Payload Decoder
- Functions to test the decoder
- Debug section with logging output

### [#](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/WisBlock-Kit-4-RAK-Built-in-Network-Server-and-Datacake/#add-decoder-and-fields-for-the-payload)Add Decoder and Fields for the Payload

1. When your devices sends data, the payload will be passed to the payload decoder, alongside the event's name. The payload decoder then transforms it to measurements.

![image-20220922151059739](assets/image-20220922151059739.png)

Add decoder

1. Copy the **Decoder function** Code:

```javascript
function Decoder(bytes, port) 
{
  var decoded = {};

  var str=bin2HexStr(bytes);

  while (str.length > 4) {
    var flag = parseInt(str.substring(6, 10), 16);
    switch (flag) {
    case 0x0268:// Wind Direction
        decoded.relative_humidity_2 = parseFloat((parseShort(str.substring(10, 14), 16)* 0.1).toFixed(1));//unit:%RH
        str = str.substring(8);
        break;
     case 0x0167:// Temperature
        decoded.temperature_1 = parseFloat((parseShort(str.substring(10, 14), 16) * 0.1).toFixed(1)) //unit: ¬∞C
        str = str.substring(8);
        break;
      default:
        str = str.substring(7);
        break;

    }
  }
   try {
        decoded.lorawan_rssi = (!!normalizedPayload.gateways && !!normalizedPayload.gateways[0] && normalizedPayload.gateways[0].rssi) || 0;
        decoded.lorawan_snr = (!!normalizedPayload.gateways && !!normalizedPayload.gateways[0] && normalizedPayload.gateways[0].snr) || 0;
        decoded.lorawan_datarate = normalizedPayload.data_rate;           
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("Failed to read gateway metadata");
    }
  return decoded;
} 
function bin2HexStr(bytesArr) 
{
  var str = "";
  for(var i=0; i<bytesArr.length; i++) {
    var tmp = (bytesArr[i] & 0xff).toString(16);
    if(tmp.length == 1) {
      tmp = "0" + tmp;
    }
    str += tmp;
  }
  return str;
}

// convert string to short integer
function parseShort(str, base) 
{
  var n = parseInt(str, base);
  return (n << 16) >> 16;
}

// convert string to triple bytes integer
function parseTriple(str, base) 
{
  var n = parseInt(str, base);
  return (n << 8) >> 8;
}
```

Now that you have a decoder, head to the **Fields** section and click **+Add Field**.

![image-20220922151401851](assets/image-20220922151401851.png)
